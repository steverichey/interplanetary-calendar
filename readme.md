# InterplanetaryCalendar

Adds support to calendars using non-geocentric reference points.

## About

The Foundation calendar makes a number of assumptions about reference points in its calendar implementation. Namely, it assumes coordinated universal time using the Unix epoch and earth days. However, this may not be suitable for applications which are designed for use on other planets.
